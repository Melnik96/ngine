BUILDING LIBSIMDX86
-------------------
*** Main project page at www.sourceforge.net/projects/simdx86

SIMDx86 requires the following tools:
NASM/YASM -- Netwide Assembler (for x86 code),  YASM (for x86/x86-64 code)
ANSI C compiler

SIMDx86 now uses a GNU make based build system. This greatly simplifies development as GNU make offers much more than a standard POSIX make tool, such as conditional compilation. If you do not have GNU make (hereafter refered to as "gmake"), then please download from the GNU FTP server and compile it; or request it from your operating system vendor.

Once you have GNU make installed, just type "gmake". If you hit any errors, please report them on the SourceForge website www.sourceforge.net/projects/simdx86


WIN32 BASED SYSTEMS
-------------------
Normally, all one needs to do is type "gmake" at the shell prompt. Obviously, this won't work for quite as well for Win32-based systems due to the lack of a "uname" command. Cygwin provides this functionality, but requires a decent size installation. SIMDx86 intends on supporting MSVC++ as a build environment, and any other build environment as popularity demands. It is possible to modify the makefile system to skip platform/processor detection, but such changes will not be merged into the main tree.
